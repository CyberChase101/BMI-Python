How it works:

* The calculate_bmi function is defined with three input parameters: weight_pounds, height_feet, and height_inches. It calculates the BMI using weight in pounds and height in feet and inches.


* The height in feet is converted to inches by multiplying it by 12. This allows us to have a unified unit for height in inches.


* The BMI is calculated using the formula (weight_pounds / (height_inches ** 2)) * 703, where weight_pounds is the weight in pounds and height_inches is the height in inches. The factor of 703 is used to convert the result to the appropriate BMI units.


* The calculated BMI is returned as the output of the function.


* The user is prompted to enter their weight in pounds, height in feet, and remaining inches of their height.


* The calculate_bmi function is called with the user-provided inputs to calculate the BMI.


* The result is displayed, showing the calculated BMI with two decimal places.


* The program provides a simple and easy way to calculate BMI using weight in pounds and height in feet and inches. However, it's important to note that BMI is a basic measure of body composition and doesn't consider factors such as muscle mass or distribution of fat. For a more comprehensive assessment of one's health, it's recommended to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized guidance and analysis.
